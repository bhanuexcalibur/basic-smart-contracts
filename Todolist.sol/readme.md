# ToDoList

Smart contract of todolist

## Description

```bash
  So there are two smart contracts which are having a funcitonality
  of todo.


  - One is the with array.
    In this we create a array and store all the todo's in that.
    We fetch data and amend in the array only.
    It stores just the description.
    In this we are using mapping which helps us to have a unique user
    to have their unique todos.

  - The second is with the stuct.
    In this we are using struct to save the data.
    The struct have two components, which are the description and the
    status which tells us whether the task is completed or not.
